            I like to code solutions to problem I feel worthy of solving I spend
            most of my time looking through open source codebases, contributing
            to these codebases and sometimes building my own projects
            <br />I also like to do competetive programming I have 2 stars on
            codechef to show for it and I am looking to make it to 5 stars by
            the end of my college.

            <br />
            To me the best part of being a developer is the ability to create
            something out of nothing
            <br />I am always looking for new opportunities to work on projects
            that will make a difference in the world.

            shows that a change has been made by that project and being a part
            of that change is the best feeling in the world.
